**Red BIOS Editor** is a utility that allows you to increase or decrease frequencies, as well as adjust various parameters of video cards. Unlike other programs, **Red BIOS Editor** directly modifies the video card **BIOS.** While flashing the **BIOS** always comes with some risk, there are undeniable advantages to this method.

# Benefits of Red BIOS Editor

- A large number of video cards are supported.
- There is no need to run various overclocking utilities at Windows startup.
- You can also tune the **GPU power,** which is beyond the power of most common utilities.
- **Red BIOS Editor** allows you to control the parameters of the cooling fan of the video card.

# Key features

- Can display and modify many information lines within the **BIOS** file, including device ID and vendor ID.
- Refers to each **PowerPlay** state and can change the **GPU** clock speed, **RAM** clock speed, and voltage for each separately.
- Displays the **PowerPlay** structure in **BIOS.**
- Also displays the voltages that the card can use.
- Can very conveniently graphically display and modify four different fan controllers and automatically detect which controller is used for a specific **BIOS.**
- **RBE** modifies the **BIOS** overdrive signature to allow for a higher overclocking limit. Signatures can also be extracted and saved to a file.
- Because of this, the annoying spinning bug will disappear from some maps.
- Provides excellent **PowerPlay.**
- Contains a profile editor for accessing hidden features of the **CCC panel.**
- Retrieving and flashing all **BIOSes** from **RBE** using the built-in **WinFlash** interface.

**Red BIOS Editor** allows writing all MPT modifications directly to **RX 5700, 5700 XT (X)** and **RX 5600 XT BIOS** and output this **BIOS** as a writable file.

Polaris tabs only become visible after you have loaded the appropriate **BIOS.** In the **Clock and Voltage** section, you will find the most important settings to breathe some more life into the card. The labels speak for themselves.

**Power Tune** provides more resources, but donâ€™t rush to get carried away. Adjust as much as necessary, otherwise you can disable your video card. **The fan control** is also adaptable and is a really interesting field for your own experiments. However, you must be very careful with memory timings.
